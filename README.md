## ü§î Team Assignment Logic  
- During the **signup process**, the user is prompted to select their favorite color.
- Based on the selected color, a corresponding *team* is automatically assigned to the user on the backend.
- The selected team is stored in the **MongoDB database** as part of the user's profile.  
- On each login, the backend retrieves the user's preferred team and sends it to the frontend.  
- The frontend dynamically adjusts the **color scheme and theme** based on the team.
- The theme is selected from a predefined array of styles based on the user's assigned team.
- A theme context is implemented to manage and propagate the theme styles across all components, ensuring consistent styling throughout the app.
- This logic ensures a personalized experience for every user.
